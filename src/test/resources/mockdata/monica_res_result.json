Smart Accounts are used by Cisco Partners or Customers to manage their Cisco Software licenses. Partners and Customers can do this by associating their licenses to the company instead of individuals.





\\n


Virtual Accounts are sub-accounts under the Smart Account that Customers and Partners can create to organize and structure the Smart Account.





\\n


Smart Accounts are mandatory for Smart Licensing and Enterprise License Agreement (ELA) but are optional and recommended for Traditional (PAK-based) licenses.





\\n


Smart Account Administrators associate the individuals who need to view or manage the licenses for the Smart Account. You have the option to assign an order to your Smart Account or Virtual Account when ordering. All users associated with the Smart Account or Virtual Account can view and manage the licenses from the licensing portals when the order is booked and the licenses are fulfilled.





\\n


Note: Smart Accounts are identified by the Smart Account Name, not the Smart Account Number.

A Partner can only initiate or request a Smart Account on a customer's behalf.





\\n


Partners can request a Customer Smart Account on the behalf of their customers from Cisco Software Central. Partners can also request a Customer Smart Account for their customer from the Cisco Commerce Workplace (CCW).





\\n


Only a customer can activate the Smart Account because it requires the customer's company to agree to a Cisco agreement. Customers can also directly request and create their Smart Account from Cisco Software Central.





\\n


The End Customer User needs to complete the Smart Account creation.
